# VisionDetect-AI 🔍

VisionDetect-AI is an **Object Detection System** built using **YOLOv8**.  
It can detect multiple objects in real-time and provides accurate bounding boxes for each prediction.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection with YOLOv8  
- Supports images, videos, and webcam streams  
- Lightweight and efficient for deployment  
- Easy to customize for new datasets
